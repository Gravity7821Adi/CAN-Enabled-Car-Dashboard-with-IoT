# ðŸš— Car Dashboard with CAN & IoT Integration
An advanced embedded system designed to collect, process, and visualize real-time data from a vehicle using multiple sensors and communication protocols. 
This project showcases integration of automotive-grade embedded software with local and cloud-based visualization for enhanced monitoring, analysis, and feedback.

ðŸ”§Project Overview
*   Developed in Embedded C for STM32 microcontrollers using STM32CubeIDE
*   Utilizes FreeRTOS for efficient multitasking and reliable sensor data handling
*   Real-time acquisition from multiple sensors: ultrasonic, temperature, speed, and GPS
*   Data transmitted via CAN bus protocol for robust, synchronized inter-device communication
*   Local feedback through a TFT display for driver alerts and real-time visualization
*   Remote monitoring enabled via ThingsBoard platform for cloud connectivity, data logging, and dashboards
*   Designed for modularity, reliability, and real-time performance across hardware and software layers
